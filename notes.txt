Fighting Fantasy combat analysis

C [.c] for simulation and stochastic optimal control
Mathematica [.nb] for algebra and visualisation
Bash [.sh] and Gnuplot [.sh] for basic analysis and visualisation

All code should run in under ten minutes except heuristic.c which will take longer O(days)

run.sh : compiles and runs all simulation code (analysis then follows with Mathematica notebooks as below)

previous-results.tar.gz -- previously-run results of simulation code 

Fig 1 -- victory probability theory vs simulation for no luck
  battlesim.c simulates combat dynamics with no Luck strategy -> simscan.txt
  simscan-analyse.nb compares these simulation results with theoretical expression and visualises

Fig 2 -- victory probability theory vs simulation for simple luck
  simpleluck.c simulates combat dynamics with simple Luck strategy -> simpleluck.txt
  simpleluck-analyse.nb compares these simulation results with theoretical expression and visualises

Fig 4 and Fig S1 -- optimal strategies
  optimal-strategies.c runs stochastic optimal control approach to derive optimal strategies for each state -> optimal-strategies.txt
  optimal-strategies-analyse.nb visualises these results 

Fig 5 -- simulated good heuristic strategies
  heuristic.c simulates various heuristic Luck strategies -> heuristic.txt
  heuristic-analyse.nb visualises these results

Fig 6 -- luck threshold in simulated approaches
  thresh-stats.sh [Bash] extracts Luck threshold statistics from heuristic.txt
  plotthresh.sh [Gnuplot] plots these results

Fig S1 -- full optimal strategies
